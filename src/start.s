// mrs: Load value from a system register to one of the general purpose registers (x0â€“x30)
// and: Perform the logical AND operation. We use this command to strip the last byte from the value we obtain from the mpidr_el1 register.
// cbz: Compare the result of the previously executed operation to 0 and jump (or branch in ARM terminology) to the provided label if the comparison yields true.
// b: Perform an unconditional branch to some label.
// adr: Load a label's relative address into the target register.
// sub: Subtract values from two registers.
// bl: "Branch with a link": perform an unconditional bra/nch and store the return address in x30 (the link register). When the subroutine is finished, use the ret instruction to jump back to the return address.
// mov: Move a value between registers or from a constant to a register.
// ldr: load data from memory into a register
// str: store (write) a value from a register into memory at a specified address.
